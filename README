Scripts to help a dungeon master do his job. This was made with D&D
4th edition in mind, but may be generally useful. The basic idea is to
help automate a lot of the tedious stuff like figuring out initiative
order etc, but not to turn D&D into a MUD.  Think of it like a
note-taking system that is structured around a specific purpose, but
with a few extra features that help out.
